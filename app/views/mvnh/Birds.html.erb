    <h1>Birds</h1>
    <p>
    Mole Valley is home to a wide range of bird species, many of which favour
    particular habitats. Some of these are highlighted below:
    </p>

     <h2>River Mole</h2>

      <img class="birds" src="<%= asset_path 'Kingfisher back view.jpg'%>">
      <img class="birds" src="<%= asset_path 'Kingfisher with fish.jpg'%>">
      <img class="birds" src="<%= asset_path 'Kingfishers-mating-menu.jpg'%>">
     
      
    <p> 
     <b>Kingfishers</b> can be seen along the length of the river â€“ a flash of blue and
      orange flying swiftly past. Grey wagtails are also common often seen around
      the Leatherhead Town Bridge and in Winter goosanders can be seen swimming
      along the river.
      </p>
     
     
     <h2>Ponds and streams</h2>
     <img class="birds" src="<%= asset_path 'Grey_Wagtail.jpg'%>">
     <p>
     Many common birds can be seen on our ponds and streams including mallards,
     coots, moorhens, Canada geese, greylag geese and grey wagtails.
     </p>

     

     <h2>Farmland</h2>
     
     <img class="birds" src="<%= asset_path 'red legged partridge.jpg'%>">
     <p>
      There is a range of birds found in our farmland habitat including game birds
      such as pheasants and red-legged partridge. In the hedgerows you can see
      yellowhammers and finches and feeding in the fields there are often skylarks
      and thrushes; in the Winter the song and mistle thrushes are joined by
      redwings and fieldfares from Scandinavia.
      </p>

     <h2>Woodland</h2>
     <img class="birds" src="<%= asset_path 'lesser redpoll.jpg'%>">    
     <p>
      Our woodland areas host a wide variety of birds including 5 species of tit
      (blue, great, coal, long-tailed and marsh), great spotted woodpeckers,
      redpolls and siskins.
    
      </p>

     <h2>Urban parks, green spaces and gardens</h2>
     <img class="birds" src="<%= asset_path 'House-Martin.jpg'%>">

     <p>
     Another rich environment for several species of birds which include:
     green woodpeckers, robins, blackbirds, tits, pied wagtails and many more.
     </p>

     <h2>Commons and Heaths</h2>
     <img  class="birds" src="<%= asset_path 'Nightingale.jpg'%>">
    
     <p>
      Our <b>commons and heathlands</b> are home all year round to birds such as finches
      and tits. Rarer summer migrants include woodlarks (Headley Heath),
      nightingales and warblers (Bookham Common). Arguably the most important
      bird site in Mole Valley is Bookham Common for nightingales.
